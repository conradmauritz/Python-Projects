The purpose of the TableConsistencyCheckReport.py script is to retrieve the latest consistency check results (any inconsistencies found, any errors reported during a consistency check, and the last consistency check run date and time) from a HANA tenant database, which is then placed into an email and sent to the necessary recipients. 

The inspiration for the script was to reduce the manual effort required to frequently execute manual checks on multiple systems, and to automate the process instead.
